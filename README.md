# Lagos Okada Ban: Understanding the Challenges of First & Last Mile Transportation
Lagos Okada Ban: The Last Mile is the Most Important Mile 

This project started as attempt to quantify, in some form, the hardship that Lagosians faced as they adjusted to the ban on Okada and Keke Napep.

To quantify this hardship, the thinking was to scrape Twitter over the course of a week and to identify places where people had difficulty finding transport. These could be found in sentences containing the sequence "...from \[A\] to \[B\]". If A & B can be extracted, then it should be possible to calculate the distances involved using GIS tools. Over the course of a week, it would then be possible to use the mean or median distance to show how this Ban had changed life for Lagosians. Places frequently mentioned in this complaints would also be important for players looking to capture value by providing transport services where it is now needed the most. 

However, as the project started, it took on new form. The data collected from Twitter allowed us to comment on the Lagos Transport Sector and how the Ban affected not just commutters but also players such as Gokada, Uber, PlentyWaka etc. 

In the end, this project was turned in as submission for the CC Hub Data For Governance Challenge with my team, Ocean's Five. Unfortunately, we did not get to participate in the Challenge but putting together this project and the rest of our application was a learning experience. 

The notebooks are a bit rough, as things can get in the heat of the moment. Good thing I am done with my service year now. I'll find time to clean it up slowly over the next few weeks.
